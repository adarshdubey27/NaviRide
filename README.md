NaviRide – Smart Digital Solution for Navi Mumbai's Public Transit
As part of an initiative to transform public transportation in Navi Mumbai, I developed NaviRide, an advanced digital platform designed to enhance the city's bus transportation system. This project provides a comprehensive and efficient transit experience by integrating features for real-time bus tracking, QR code-based ticket verification, automated route management, and customer engagement.

Key Features:

Real-Time Tracking: Enables commuters to track bus locations, reducing waiting times and improving commute planning.
QR Code Ticketing System: Simplifies ticketing through QR code scanning, ensuring secure and contactless ticket verification.
Automated Route Management: Supports effective allocation and management of bus routes to optimize transit operations.
Comprehensive User and Admin Panels: The user panel allows for easy booking history access, ticket display, and transaction tracking, while the admin panel supports detailed management of drivers, conductors, routes, and monthly pass systems.
Developed using Flutter and Dart for seamless cross-platform functionality, NaviRide showcases modern, user-centric UI/UX design to deliver a reliable, intuitive, and streamlined public transport experience.

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into transportation management, real-time data processing, and user engagement strategies, contributing to Navi Mumbai's smart city initiatives.
